DOT-YEAH
========

Info
----
This is the personal configuration files repository of TheRedMood. These are
the result of my take on other great peoples configuration files. 

The setup file relies on python3.

Setup
-----
To fully harness the power of these configuration files you need:

-   zsh - Powerful shell.
-   rxvt-unicode-256color - Good terminal emulator.

To set up, execute:

```Shell
$ git clone https://github.com/TheRedMood/dot-yeah.git ~/.dot-yeah
$ cd ~/.dot-yeah
$ ./setup.py
```
Just follow along the setup script and you are good to go!
