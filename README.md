This was made by TheRedMood and is stolen from several others.
Some of it is mine, some is others. Please give feedback and enjoy.

To fully harness the power of these config files you need:

conky   - realtime system info dsiplayer
mpd     - music player deamon
ncmpcpp - front end for mpd
vim     - The best editor :)
urxvt   - My favorite terminal
zsh     - A shell
dmenu   - A programs launcher

The setup file relays on python3.
